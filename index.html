<h1>My journey to the finish line...</h1>
<h2>26 miles to go</h2>

<div class="first">
  <p> Running in the rain <span class="price">1</span><br />
  <small>Through the cold dark winter I'll be out running in the rain. Why? Because I'm training for the London marathon! Less than a month now until the first half-marathon event! </small></p>
</div>

<div class="second">
  <p>Events <span class="price">2</span><br />
  <small>I've signed up to run the Watford half marathon on 2nd Feb, followed by the Richmond Park half marathon on 23rd March and finally the big event, the FULL London Marathon, 26.3 miles on 13th April. All this running is in aid of the MS Trust! </small></p>
</div>
  
<div class="dessert">
  <p> Why? <span class="price">3</span><br />
  <small>Why am I doing this? The MS Trust have supported my family for the last 12 years in many ways and this is my chance to say thank you by raising some much needed funding towards research, training for NSH nurses, and information and advice for people affected by MS. </small></p>
